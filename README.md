## What is ROS?

ROS, or Robot Operating System, is an open-source framework that provides a collection of libraries and tools to help you build and manage robot applications. It enables developers to modularize a robot’s software into independent processes called nodes, which can communicate with one another using a standardized interface.

For example, imagine a robotic arm in a manufacturing assembly line. In such a project:
- **Modularity**: Each function of the robotic arm—such as movement control, sensor feedback, and error detection—can be developed as separate nodes.
- **Communication**: Nodes exchange information seamlessly via topics (for continuous data, like sensor readings) and services (for specific requests, like executing a movement command).
- **Scalability**: As the project grows, additional capabilities (such as vision processing or advanced control algorithms) can be integrated without a complete redesign.

Don't worry about these new terms; we will discuss them in further sections and you'll quickly get used to them.
